# CapitalFX™ Synergy Series.

## Model Card

More coming soon: my foray into state-of-the-art market and stock price forecasting/analysis. This is not any standard LSTM or ARIMA model.

## Featuring

- The in-house 'ViRAU' adaptive activation function.
- The high-performance Hybrid Transformer Core adopted from EnhanceFX™ VI.
- The 'extremeHEAD' mechanism, derived directly from NeuralFusion™ II’s vLMM-oriented SA.

## Innovation

These are combined with thoughtful feature engineering and a powerful blend of staggered GLU/LSTM gates, drawing on every gram of my expertise in AI, experimental super-resolution, NLP, quantum analysis, symbolic AI, and experience in complicated training dynamics.

The result is a model ready to deliver solid, market-beating signal accuracy with unprecedented competitive performance.

Just as EnhanceFX™ is ready to set a new benchmark in super-resolution, CapitalFX™ is hopefully, poised to revolutionise quantitative trading firms across the globe.

This model is also primed for use with the Jane Street Kaggle forecasting competition dataset, alongside a purpose-built architecture for formal submission. (if time permits)
